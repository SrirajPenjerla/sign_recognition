# sign_recognition
Project Description:  
The sign language detection translates the sign language, in which user forms a hand shape that is structured signs or gestures. In sign language, the configuration of the fingers, the orientation of the hand, and the relative position of fingers and hands to the body are the expressions of a deaf and mute person.our model detects the sign gestures  using computer vision ,and uses a module called media pipe to detect the landmarks and positions of body postures , we use a LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) model to predict the sign gestures.


Objective:
The purpose of Sign Language Recognition (SLR) systems is to provide an efficient and accurate way to convert sign language into text for example  enabling very young children to interact with others using the system.
